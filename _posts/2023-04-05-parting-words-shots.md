I long \| love to be this cryptic little being who disappears off into the wilderness \| country \| away with a few parting words: 
- i hope you find all you seek
- i hope you find what you are looking for, rosa
- good luck \[for what?\]
- i hope what you search for finds you \| meets you half-way
- i hope what is lost becomes found
- heres hoping someone finds you
- you were \| are comfortable
- thank you \[for what? \| the encouragement\]
- i'll miss you
- i hope you think of \| see me in mundane things
- i'll see you in less time than last time \[\- lucy spraggan, in this church\]
- i hope to see you again \[unexpectedly\]
