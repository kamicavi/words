I've always loved the rain.

That's a lie we all tell ourselves.

Humans hate the rain.

It grinds society to a halt

And yet we smile. Grin. 

Look out upon the rain from the edge of warmth, feel the splashes on your skin.

Watch the skies turn, the sun fade, the clouds turn from grey to black.

See the lights reflect in the water as the darkness sets in.

Run from it, run into it.

Dance.

We grin.

I've always loved the rain.
